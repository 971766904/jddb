# %%
# this examlpe shows how to build a ML mode to predict disruption and
# evaluate its performance using jddb
# this depands on the output FileRepo of basic_data_processing.py

# %%
# init FileRepo and MetaDB

# %%

# train test split on shot not sample

# %%

# create x and y matrix for ML models

# %%

# use LightGBM to train a model.

# %%

# infer on test shots

# save sample result to a FileRepo, so when predicting shot with differnet trgging logic,
# you don't have to re-infor the testshot

# using the sample reulst to predict disruption on shot, and save result to result file using result module.

# simply chage different disruptivity triggering level and logic, get many result.

# %% evaluation

# add result to the report

# find best result

# plot all metrics
